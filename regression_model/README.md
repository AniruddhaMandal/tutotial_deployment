# Deployment of Machine Learning Model

    This application is designed to predict the hose price. It trains from the training data set, wich is saved in the `datasets` foder.
    The data is collected from the [Kaggle House Price competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data). 

This applection is a full fledged python programme as a Machine Learning application. This application includes feature engineering, data preprocessing, data validation, machine learning algorithm. It uses Lasso as machine learning algorithm. Finall we include CI/CD and 
deploy it.

This application is a part of a tutorial project.
